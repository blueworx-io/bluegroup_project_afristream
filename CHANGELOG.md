# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.2.0] - 2026-07-07

### Added

- What to Watch now pulls real catalog data from TMDB (free, non-commercial tier): trending movies, trending series, and new releases/episodes, with real poster artwork and rating badges, refreshed twice a day. ([#1](https://github.com/blueworx-io/bluegroup_project_afristream/issues/1))
- New public REST endpoint `afristream/v1/watch` — the plugin fetches TMDB server-side (key stays out of the browser, responses cached 12h in a transient) and the portal falls back to its built-in curated lists whenever no key is configured or TMDB is unreachable. The key comes from the `AFRISTREAM_TMDB_API_KEY` constant in `wp-config.php` (or the `afristream_tmdb_api_key` option).
- The local preview server mirrors the endpoint at `/api/watch` (set a `TMDB_API_KEY` env var to see live data on localhost) plus a deterministic fixture mode used by two new Playwright tests covering the API-data path.
- TMDB attribution line shown in the What to Watch section whenever live data is displayed.

### Changed

- Sport, Live TV, and Collections intentionally stay curated lists — the sport cards already say which channel each fixture is on, and no free API provides South African broadcast listings.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-07

### Added

- Initial project scaffold on the `bluegroup_core_foundation` guardrails: WordPress CI caller workflow, shared pull request and issue templates, shared Claude Code settings, `CLAUDE.md` from the foundation template, and `approved-deps.json`.
- AfriStream Customer Portal plugin (`afristream-portal.php`, `[afristream_portal]` shortcode) implementing the Claude Design handoff (AfriStream Portal v2): App Profile credentials with copy-to-clipboard, What to Watch (search, filter drawer, poster rows, live sport, live TV channels, collections), Tips & Tricks, and the Troubleshooting guide with per-device tabs.
- Local preview harness (`npm run preview` → http://localhost:4173) so the portal can be viewed without a WordPress install, plus Playwright smoke tests that run against it until a staging URL exists.
- Plugin build script staging the deployable folder to `dist/`, and the `afristream-portal.zip` deployment artifact.
